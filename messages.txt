Dear Google Security Team, I am writing to express my frustration after falling victim to a phishing attack. This incident resulted in the unauthorized access to my personal information, causing me significant distress and financial loss. I urge Google to take immediate action to enhance security measures and prevent such incidents from happening to other users. Your prompt attention to this matter would be greatly appreciated.
